# Battleship

This implementation of the classic game Battleship was made as part of The Odin Project curriculum.
In this edition of the game one human player competes against one computer-controlled player.
Each player tries to sink all their opponents' ships before their own ships are sunk.

This game is live on GitHub Pages here: [Battleship by McKathlin](https://mckathlin.github.io/battleship)
